## Code Base

- This code base is built using TypeScript, Vanilla CSS, and Web Components.
- The tooling used in this project includes: Vite, PostCSS (with `postcss-nesting`), Clerk (for authentication), and Convex (for database interactions).

## Components

- Each component is defined in its own file in the `src/components` directory.
- There can be exceptions to this rule, when a set of components are closely related and can be grouped together in a single file.
- The component file should export the component class.
- IMPORTANT: Components are created using a class constructor (i.e. `new BenchButton()`) instead of `document.createElement('bench-button')`.
- IMPORTANT: A web component constructor never accepts any parameters.
- Internal state is always stored in private properties (e.g. `_id`, `_selected`).
- The component's CSS styles should be defined in a separate CSS file in the same directory as the component, and should be imported into the component file.

## Styles

- The project uses Vanilla CSS for styling.
- The `postcss-nesting` plugin is used to allow nesting of CSS rules, which helps in organizing styles in a more readable way.
- Global styles are defined in the `src/main.css` file.
- The `style` attribute should never be used in the HTML of the components. Instead, styles should be defined in the CSS file and applied as classes to the elements.
- Dynamically applying styles using JavaScript is allowed, but should be used sparingly and only when necessary. The preferred way to apply styles is through CSS classes.

## General Guidelines

- Remember to always check for missing or unused imports when adding, removing, or refactoring code.
- Padding, margin, and border should always be defined in pixels (px) for consistency.
- Font sizes should always be defined in rem units for consistency.

## EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

- The code base is opinionated and follows strict guidelines and conventions.
- It is crucial to follow these guidelines and conventions to maintain consistency and readability across the code base.
- The guidelines can be found in the root `GUIDELINES.md` file. It is of the **utmost** importance that you read and follow these guidelines when working on the project.
- The document is long, but please read them EXTREMELY carefully and ensure you understand them before starting work on the project. They are designed to help you write clean, maintainable, and efficient code, and to ensure that the project remains scalable and easy to work with.
- If you have any questions or need clarification, feel free to ask. Thank you for your attention to detail and your commitment to maintaining the quality of the code base.
